Peasant uprisings throughout Asia against all oppression succeed in their biddings as the shackles of religion, fanaticism and bureaucracy are weakened on Dhaka, Qarmatia and Canton. Turkish hordes regroup to strike at the heart of the 'Rus once more, as the Manchu hordes settle as a kingdom around an immortal ruler. Last but not least, Madagascar is unified.

As the critical eleventh day of the eleventh month came - a mere day after the fall of Ladislaus of Poland - fifteen new entities spring to life to bring nothing but bad news for the world. Odd states ran by people of varied skill in rulership, their decisions are bound to change this world forever. Once more, the world is obliged to ask itself: will McMuller survive past 1480?"

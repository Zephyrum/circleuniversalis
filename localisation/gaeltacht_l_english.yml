 another_risin:0 "A History of Risings and Rebellions"
 another_risin_desc:0 "With our experience in fighting the English, we have learned many things about warfare. In particular the Jacobite risings of 1715, 1719 and 1745 taught us many things about musket warfare. The time has come to implement these weapons into our way of fighting and abandon the screaming charges, broadswords and other hand held weaponry. Perhaps one day, the Gaels will teach the English a lesson or two."

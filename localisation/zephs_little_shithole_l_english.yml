 zpj_money:0 "Zaibatsus"
 zpj_money_desc:0 "The recruitment of displaced richmen from our conquests - including unlanded daimyos - allowed us to form several state-supported monopolies keep the basic goods of our economy constantly flowing. The richmen that benefit from such development are also encouraged to invest back in the form of major acquisitions within the country."
 zpj_blob:0 "Nezumiko"
 zpj_blob_desc:0 "In order to run a wide empire, an expansive bureaucracy is needed, albeit such is expensive and tends to bring about corruption. As a solution, we also made our provincial governors sell beauty products to pay for their own bureaucratic apparatus, as well as given them permission to recruit people from within their province to distribute these goods as well."
 zpj_shipdmg:0 "Yattsu no mon no keisei"
 zpj_shipdmg_desc:0 "Reapplying the legendary Eight Gates Formation of old as a naval concept was shown to solve many of the common problems with it. The octuple infantry formation had glaring weak spots between subformations in any of the lines, an issue that does not exist at high seas, provided your ships are built toughly enough."
 zpj_siege:0 "Ketsu Waapu"

 zpj_firedmg_desc:0 "When folded a thousand times, even rifles shoot harder. It's vastly superior to any other weapon on Earth. Trust me, I know everything about Japanese history and their Bushido code, which I follow 100%."
 zpj_shipnodie:0 "Kusofune!"
 zpj_shipnodie_desc:0 "The naval war cry of our Imperial Navy has become a longstanding tradition before and after our long list of naval successes ever since we finally destroyed the final canoe within the Shogun's service. Fuck Canoe!"

 zpj_bodies_hitting_floor_noises_desc:0 "We're not a cult. Cults are exclusive. We recruit literally anyone to serve as expendable manpower in our army."
